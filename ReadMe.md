## Description
I used Javascript to practice creating an interactive website that allows the user to update and create a To-Do list. The Task Board Application is a simple Kanban-style board for managing tasks. It allows users to add, delete, and drag-and-drop tasks across different status lanes. Tasks are stored in the browser's localStorage to remain during any page reloads.

## User Usage
Click the "Add Task" button to open the modal. Fill in the task details and click "Add Task" to save. Drag and drop tasks between "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done" columns. Click the "Delete" button on a task card to remove it.
